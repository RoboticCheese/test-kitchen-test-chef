# test-kitchen-test

This cookbook keeps track of all the different CI services I'm aware of and
which ones support using Docker and the kitchen-docker driver within a build.

Currently, that subset of hosted CI services seems to be only CircleCI and, as
of August, 2015, TravisCI. Working example Test Kitchen and CI configs are
provided.
